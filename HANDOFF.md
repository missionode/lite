# Chakra Meditation — Active Handoff

## START

- Objective: improve Yoga Bridge and Bath timing discoverability and toggle behavior.
- Target root: `/Users/lekshmisyam/Desktop/Ikigai/lite`.
- Stack: static HTML/CSS/JavaScript PWA; no dependencies, backend, database, or browser gate.
- Permanent constraint: preserve the existing journey order unless explicitly changed.

## MID

- Yoga Bridge is a stage before the Crown chakra.
- Bath is an optional nested stage that runs before Yoga.
- Timing values persist in `localStorage` under the existing `chakra_time_*` keys.
- The UI already had visibility helpers and estimate logic; this checkpoint consolidates the controls without changing the storage contract.

## NOW

- Implemented grouped Yoga preparation, per-pose, pose-selection, Bath toggle, and Bath duration controls under Yoga Bridge.
- Added visible copy explaining `Bath → Yoga → Crown` order.
- Bath duration now appears only when Yoga Bridge and Bath Session are enabled.
- Session estimates include Yoga only when enabled and Bath only when its toggle is enabled.
- Bath minimum duration is now 60 seconds for a practical short test while retaining an 1,800-second maximum.
- Validation: `static` evidence level — syntax, JSON, DOM ID uniqueness, local asset references, and diff whitespace checks passed.
- Browser/manual visual validation remains open because it was not required for this checkpoint.
- Implemented a mobile UI pass for Settings and Lobby: scroll-safe settings layout, short-screen lobby layout, safe-area spacing, larger touch targets, mobile-friendly sliders, responsive buttons, compact headings, and viewport-safe mixer/controls.
- Normalized vertical spacing for Audio Levels, Journey Timings, Yoga Timing, and Bath Duration using shared settings-panel and settings-mixer rules instead of repeated inline section spacing.
- Removed the empty chakra image source and added guarded image loading so chakra, deity, Yoga, and Music Only symbols remain hidden until the selected asset loads successfully, preventing the brief broken-image flash.
- Grouped the Lobby Begin Journey and Settings controls into a dedicated vertical action group with explicit spacing and full-width touch-friendly sizing.
- Added explicit top spacing above the Lobby “Meditation Room” heading.
- Decision: retain local hand-authored CSS; do not add Tailwind CDN. This preserves the offline PWA behavior and avoids introducing a runtime styling dependency. A future Tailwind migration would require a deliberate build-based migration to local static CSS.
- Repaired the orphaned `#aura-bg` CSS selector and replaced unsupported `width: stretch` declarations with `width: 100%`.
- Validation: `static` evidence level — JavaScript syntax, JSON parsing, DOM ID checks, responsive CSS contract checks, and diff whitespace checks passed.
- Browser/manual visual validation is `BLOCKED` because no browser backend is available in this environment (`agent.browsers.list()` returned no backends).
- Next step: open the app on a real mobile viewport and verify settings scrolling, lobby spacing, slider dragging, and tap target comfort.
